kind of contract that will be deployed\n * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused.

This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n ===="},"fullyImplemented":true,"linearizedBaseContracts":[168],"name":"Initializable","nameLocation":"2412:13:0","scope":169,"usedErrors":[],"usedEvents":[14]}],"license":"MIT"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol":{"id":1,"ast":{"absolutePath":"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol","id":499,"exportedSymbols":{"AddressUpgradeable":[498]},"nodeType":"SourceUnit","src":"101:9274:1","nodes":[{"id":170,"nodeType":"PragmaDirective","src":"101:23:1","nodes":[],"literals":["solidity","^","0.8",".1"]},{"id":498,"nodeType":"ContractDefinition","src":"194:9180:1","nodes":[{"id":186,"nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","src":"1423:320:1","nodes":[],"body":{"id":185,"nodeType":"Block","src":"1489:254:1","nodes":[],"statements":[{"expression":{"commonType":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"id":183,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftExpression":{"expression":{"expression":{"id":179,"name":"account","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":174,"src":"1713:7:1","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"id":180,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"memberLocation":"1721:4:1","memberName":"code","nodeType":"MemberAccess","src":"1713:12:1","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_memory_ptr","typeString":"bytes memory"}},"id":181,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"memberLocation":"1726:6:1","memberName":"length","nodeType":"MemberAccess","src":"1713:19:1","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"nodeType":"BinaryOperation","operator":">","rightExpression":{"hexValue":"30","id":182,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"1735:1:1","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_0_by_1","typeString":"int_const 0"},"value":"0"},"src":"1713:23:1","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"}},"functionReturnParameters":178,"id":184,"nodeType":"Return","src":"1706:30:1"}]},"documentation":{"id":172,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"227:1191:1","text":" @dev Returns true if `account` is a contract.\n [IMPORTANT]\n ====\n It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns\n false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.\n Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following\n types of addresses:\n  - an externally-owned account\n  - a contract in construction\n  - an address where a contract will be created\n  - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed\n Furthermore, `isContract` will also return true if the target contract within\n the same transaction is already scheduled for destruction by `SELFDESTRUCT`,\n which only has an effect at the end of a transaction.\n ====\n [IMPORTANT]\n ====\n You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!\n Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged.

One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729 Emits an {Approval} event."},"assetInfo()":{"returns":{"assetAddress":"the address of the asset","assetDecimals":"the decimals of the asset","assetType":"the type of the asset (0 for ERC20 tokens, 1 for AMM liquidity tokens, 2 for bridged yield bearing tokens like wstETH, rETH on Arbi whose the underlying asset doesn't exist on the chain)"}},"balanceOf(address)":{"details":"Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`."},"claimRewards(address)":{"details":"Emits a `ClaimRewards` event See {getRewardTokens} for list of reward tokens","params":{"user":"the user receiving their rewards"},"returns":{"rewardAmounts":"an array of reward amounts in the same order as `getRewardTokens`"}},"decimals()":{"details":"Returns the decimals places of the token."},"deposit(address,address,uint256,uint256)":{"details":"Emits a {Deposit} event Requirements: - (`tokenIn`) must be a valid base token.","params":{"amountTokenToDeposit":"amount of base tokens to be transferred from (`msg.sender`)","minSharesOut":"reverts if amount of shares minted is lower than this","receiver":"shares recipient address","tokenIn":"address of the base tokens to mint shares"},"returns":{"amountSharesOut":"amount of shares minted"}},"exchangeRate()":{"details":"SYUtils's assetToSy & syToAsset should be used instead of raw multiplication & division"},"name()":{"details":"Returns the name of the token."},"redeem(address,uint256,address,uint256,bool)":{"details":"Emits a {Redeem} event Requirements: - (`tokenOut`) must be a valid base token.","params":{"amountSharesToRedeem":"amount of shares to be burned","burnFromInternalBalance":"if true, burns from balance of `address(this)`, otherwise burns from `msg.sender`","minTokenOut":"reverts if amount of base token redeemed is lower than this","receiver":"recipient address","tokenOut":"address of the base token to be redeemed"},"returns":{"amountTokenOut":"amount of base tokens redeemed"}},"symbol()":{"details":"Returns the symbol of the token."},"totalSupply()":{"details":"Returns the amount of tokens in existence."},"transfer(address,uint256)":{"details":"Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `to`.
